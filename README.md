## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Salomi, and I am interested in all things related to Data Science and Analytics! 

- Iâ€™m currently working on building end-to-end data analytics projects using **Python, SQL, and Power BI** to strengthen my portfolio, you can find some of my projects in my [portfolio](https://salomiairy11.github.io/personal-portfolio/#/projects). Here, you will also find the the link to the project execution videos to watch the project in action. 
- Iâ€™m learning more about **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and creating interactive dashboards** to strengthen my analytics foundation.  
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **data analysis and machine learning projects** where I can grow my skills and contribute to meaningful outcomes. Additionally, I am also looking forward to collaborate on **data analysis projects and beginner-friendly open-source work** where I can learn from others and contribute value.
- I enjoy exploring patterns in data, solving real-world problems, and presenting insights that can drive decisions.  
- My long-term goal is to grow into a **Data Scientist** role, building expertise in analytics, modeling, and data-driven problem solving.
